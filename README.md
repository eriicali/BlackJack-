# BLACKJACK

This is a text-based, console, 1 player game. 

## Installation

Simply download the zip file and type into your terminal:

```bash
python {Your path}/A3_blackjack2.py
```

## Usage
The player will be dealt two cards at the beginning. Either type 'hit' (deals a new card) or 'stand' (goes to the next round) and hit enter. The goal is to have the sum of the cards get as close to 21 as possible without surpassing it.
